# Fordgobike_Tripdata Analysis

Ford GoBike system Data Analysis and Exploration This was one of the projects I worked at as part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Course. I have used Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships.

# Summary

In analysis by observing the structure of the dataset.The main area of interest was what are the factors influencing the trip duration.What was found are the different patterns from the two different users.Main users of the bike riders are of age between 20-40 age from young people uses bikes to go college and then the office going people uses bikes to go for their work place.The busiest time of the day would be during the rush hours, 7AM to 9AM in the morning and 4PM to 6PM later in the afternoon.

# Dataset 

baywheels (formally know as Ford GoBike) is a regional public bicycle sharing systems in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is one of the first of its kind and as been established since August 2013. Its bicycles are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for periods ranging from a single ride (up to 30 minutes) to a day pass or customers can purchase an annual subscription which gives them unlimited rides up to 45 minutes in duration. It has approximately 2600 number of vehicles but is expected to expand to 7000 bicycles around 540 stations in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville and San Jose. The dataset used for this exploratory analysis consist of daily individual trip data from mid 2017 to June 2020.

# Summary of findings

1)Univariate Exploration: There are maximum 140000 bike trip held for an average 700 seconds. For much better understanding of graph we will also check the bike trips with respect to minutes.From above observation we can see that the most of the customers are subscribers.The busiest time of the day would be during the rush hours, 7AM to 9AM in the morning and 4PM to 6PM later in the afternoon.Main users of the bike riders are of age between 20-40 age from young people uses bikes to go college and then the office going people uses bikes to go for their work place.

2)Bivariate Exploration: We can see that the observation shows almost all 7 days of a week people go and take rides.But we can also see that on wednesday more people take rides.We can conclude that male riders are more than female riders according to the observation.

3)Multivariate Exploration: We can see that both have an average of 4 and 12 min rides during the week. However customers are not only more present during the weekend they take longer trips as well.Separating user types, customers and subscribers, gives more insights.

# Key insights

-Main users of the bike riders are of age between 20-40 age from young people uses bikes to go college and then the office going people uses bikes to go for their work place.So by analysis we can see that the subscribers in large number are of 20-40 age.

-From analysis we can see that the gender wise change in the bar graph, so the most number of bike users are male users around 12,000 and the female users are less around 4,000.
